A basic little java program that lets you make unwanted monitors black
Personally I'm often playing games, watching youtube, in which case with this tool I make my other monitors black so they don't distract me

Known issues that have a ~0% for me to fix:
-sometimes the windows taskbar pops up ontop of the boxes
-some crappy old games when loading/going into fullscreen will mess with your monitors resolutions, which also distorts the boxes
