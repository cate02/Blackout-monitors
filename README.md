## A basic little java program that lets you make unwanted monitors black
Personally I'm often playing games, watching youtube, in which case with this tool I make my other monitors black so they don't distract me

Middle click boxes to remove them (or click the gui button)
Right click the border of the gui to close the app
Press space on a selected box to center the GUI incase you lost it

Known issues:
- sometimes the windows taskbar pops up ontop of the boxes
- some crappy old games when loading/going into fullscreen will mess with your monitors resolutions, which also distorts the boxes
