A basic little java program that lets you make unwanted monitors black
Personally I'm often playing games, watching youtube, in which case with this tool I make my other monitors black so they don't distract me

Middle click boxes to remove them (or click the gui button)
Right click the border of the gui to close the app

Known issues that have a ~0% for me to fix:
-sometimes the windows taskbar pops up ontop of the boxes
-some crappy old games when loading/going into fullscreen will mess with your monitors resolutions, which also distorts the boxes
-refresh function doesnt work
-horrendous gif and gif quality
```
